# í³° Blog Website (Frontend + API Integration)

This is a **frontend blog website** that dynamically displays posts fetched from two public APIs:
- **[DummyJSON API](https://dummyjson.com/)** â€” provides blog post content (title, body, tags, etc.)
- **[Unsplash Image API](https://unsplash.com/developers)** â€” provides random or category-based images for each post

This project demonstrates how to connect the **frontend (HTML/CSS/JS)** to **external APIs**, fetch data asynchronously, and display it dynamically.
